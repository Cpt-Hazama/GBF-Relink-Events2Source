# How to use
- Make sure your XML files are in the same directory as the script (BXM files can be converted via Nier_CLI tool)
- Run the script using Python
- Copy/Paste the QCI contents to your QC
- It's important to note that very rarely some events may have incorrect frame times, the cause of this bug is unknown but I would assume there's a problem with the original time in the BXM file

# To do
- Figure out the IDs for facialmotion, flags and effects (so I can generate proper names rather than raw IDs)
- More options?
- Built-in BXM reading without converting?

# Output
